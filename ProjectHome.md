Well now that GameMaker moved into a sandbox environment a gab has been created for those who like to do file management with GameMaker. This extension is build to fill the gab. As such one of the core components is to make the functions as transparent as possible; the functions work nearly identical to GM's build in. This means no helpfile is needed, the help comes from the GM manual.
